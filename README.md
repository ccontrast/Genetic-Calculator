Genetic Calculator
==================

This tool takes two parents with a single trait each and calculates what combined traits will make it to what percentage of offspring.

TODO:
-----

1. In the process of making it more object oriented.
2. Set up framework and database - Flask and Postgres(hosting on Heroku).
3. Manage more than a single trait at a time. 
4. If the traits expressed in offspring are part of a 'morph', display the morph name with traits.
